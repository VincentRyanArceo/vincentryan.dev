# Vincent-Ryan Arceo | Developer Portfolio

This is the source code and content for my personal developer portfolio, created to support my transition from a successful career in real estate to full-stack software development. This site serves as a live resume, a hub for current and upcoming projects, and a reflection of my continuous growth as a developer.

## üéì Background

I recently completed an intensive full-stack Java development bootcamp through **Tech Elevator**, where I gained experience building robust, database-driven applications using technologies like **Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Vue.js**.

## üß≠ About This Project

This site demonstrates:
- Front-end design and semantic HTML structure
- Clean CSS organization and layout
- Version control using Git & GitHub
- Hosting via GitHub Pages

Future updates will include backend-integrated demos and game projects built using **Java (Spring Boot)** and **Python (Flask)**.
