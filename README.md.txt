# Vincent-Ryan Arceo | Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal developer portfolio website! This site was built to document my journey transitioning from a real estate professional to a full-stack web developer. It serves as a live resume, a showcase of my coding projects, and a hub for tracking my progress as I grow in the tech industry.

## 🚀 Purpose

This website is designed to:

- Highlight my professional background and technical skills
- Showcase real-world coding projects, including:
  - A mock music & merch store for my band, Shadyside
  - Java and Python mini-games and logic challenges
- Share downloadable resources like my resume and cover letters
- Provide an up-to-date contact point for employers and collaborators

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** & **CSS3**
- **JavaScript** *(coming soon for interactive features)*
- **GitHub Pages** for deployment
- Future integrations: Java (Spring Boot), Python (Flask), PostgreSQL
